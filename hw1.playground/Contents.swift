//: ## Q1: Optionals
class Words {
    var wordA : String!
    var wordB : String!
    
    init (wordA: String?, wordB: String?) {
        self.wordA = wordA
        self.wordB = wordB
    }

//: ### Are the values passed in to the **init** function and those set to the instance
//: ### variables the same type? If not, why?


//: The values passed in to the **init** function are an optional String type while those 
//: set to the instance variables are implicitly unwrapped optional String types. Although 
//: they are of the same type, the instance variables are guaranteeing that the variable does 
//: in fact carry a string type while the optionals passed into the **init** function may have 
//: nil values.


//: ## Q2: Variable Types and Function Types
    class func arePalindromes(_ words: [String]) -> Bool {
        let reversedWords = words.map() {String($0.characters.reversed())}
        let numElements = words.count
        for i in 0 ..< numElements {
            if words[i] != reversedWords[i] {
                return false
            }
        }
        return true
    }
//: ### Why does the compiler dislike the **for loop**? Fix it.
//: ### What else is wrong with this function? You may have to refer to (but **not**
//: ### change) the code at the very bottom. Debug the function.


//: The **for loop** returns false if there ever is a word which is not a palindrome. However
//: if all words are palindromes, the loop will finish and there will be no return value. We
//: must return true after the for loop. Additionally this function acts as an instance method
//: of the type Words. we must therefore declare it as a class method.


//: ## Q3: More Functions and Object Initialization
    func isAnagram() -> Bool {
        var countLetters : [Character : Int]  = [Character : Int]()//Line X
        let lenA = self.wordA.characters.count
        let lenB = self.wordB.characters.count
        
        if lenA != lenB {
            return false
        }
        
        var arrA = Array(self.wordA.characters)
        var arrB = Array(self.wordB.characters)
        
        for i in 0...lenA-1 {
            let letter = arrA[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] { //Line Y
                countLetters[letter] = val + 1
            } else {
                countLetters[letter] = 1
            }
        }
        
        for i in 0...lenB-1 {
            let letter = arrB[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] {
                countLetters[letter] = val - 1
            } else {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        for (letter, count) in countLetters {
            if count != 0 {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        return true
    }
//: ### What is the problem with declaring **countLetters** as we do in **Line X**,
//: ### and then using it in **Line Y**? Fix it (by only changing **Line X**).
//: ### What else is wrong with this function? You may have to refer to (but **not**
//: ### change) the code at the very bottom. Debug the function.


//: The declaration of **countLetters** is not initialized and therefore causes an 
//: error when it is used in **Line Y**. To fix this, Line X must be changed to initialize
//: the dictionary. Additionally, the function previously acted as a class method which
//: caused an error when trying to call the function on a Word object. We must therefore 
//: change it to an instance method. Lastly we should change the final return value to true
//: instead of nil to be in accordance with our return type Bool.
